# humhub-basic-chat
Integrated Chat Module for Humhub v1.0+

This module adds a chat sample chat widget.  Chats older than 24 hours are deleted on a cron.

Integrates with users to get avatar and username for display.

Still needs CSS work.  Available for testing if interested.

Currently only designed to work on dashboard.  I'm not good with front end css and design, so if people can tweak, feel free.
