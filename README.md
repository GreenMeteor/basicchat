# Humhub Basic Chat
Integrated Chat Module for Humhub v1.0+

This module adds a chat sample chat widget.  Chats older than 24 hours are deleted on a cron.

Integrates with users to get avatar and username for display.

Widget now works on spaces, dashboard and profile, thanks to contributions from @WebCrew for styling and making more size agnostic

If you do not want one or more of these, its best to just edit the config and remove the lines for the section you dont want.

## Installation
1. Download the module and upload it to your modules directory >yourdomain.com>protected>modules
2. Rename module directory ```basic-chat```
3. Enable module from >Admin>Modules
